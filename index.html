      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a programmer working in quality assurance for television broadcasting. My background is in Economics and Film Studies and I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a double major in those two disciplines. I came to Canada about 5 years ago for my undergraduate studies and have just never left.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Boston, MA born and raised. I can survive up here because I didn't grow up a Bruins fan.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I really love board games and card games and I'm a big reader. I am also teaching myself fancy beer tasting techniques because my friends and I really love trying different kinds of beer.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one where I can work remotely from anywhere. I love going into a central office, but it's also nice to have the freedom to go back and stay with my family for awhile and still be able to work.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Downtown Toronto.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Right now I'm a programmer but most of my time is spent on my quality assurance responsibilities. I am self-taught which means I don't know a lot of advanced techniques or tricks to accomplish what I try to do. I would love to pivot into a job where my primary responsibilities are coding and I can do some more advanced things.</p>
